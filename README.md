# Kotlin Interactive Bot

## Overview
This is a simple interactive chatbot program written in Kotlin. The bot performs the following functions:
- Greets the user
- Asks for their name
- Guesses their age based on a mathematical trick
- Counts up to a number specified by the user
- Tests the user's programming knowledge with a multiple-choice question

## Features
- Interactive user input handling
- Age guessing based on modular arithmetic
- Basic validation for numeric inputs
- A simple programming quiz

## How It Works
The bot follows a structured flow:
1. **Greet the User:** Displays a greeting message along with the bot's name and current year.
2. **Ask for User's Name:** Reads the user's name and prints a friendly response.
3. **Guess the User's Age:** Asks the user for three remainders when their age is divided by 3, 5, and 7, then calculates the age.
4. **Counting Exercise:** Asks for a number and counts from 0 up to that number.
5. **Programming Quiz:** Asks a multiple-choice question and waits for the correct answer.
6. **End Message:** Congratulates the user upon completion.


## Example Interaction
```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2024.
Please, remind me your name.
> Alice
What a great name you have, Alice!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 5
0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!
Completed, have a nice day!
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
> 3
Please, try again.
> 2
Congratulations, have a nice day!
